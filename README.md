### Goal and Value of the Application

The goal of this application is to provide information on the UEFA Champions League (UCL) group stage fixtures from this season. For context, the UCL is the most prestigious club soccer competition in the world. In this app, you are able to see the teams from each group, the country the teams are based in, and the teams that are qualified for the following round. Using the filters and sorting options, a user might be able to get a better idea of the most successful countries, or the most difficult groups (if familiar with the teams), for example. One can add favorite teams to your bookmarks to save them. You can also switch to the standings view, which uses a football API to render the standings for the competition and give the user more specific information about the results in the group fixtures (wins, losses, goal differences, etc.). This app falls into a specific niche but provides a good overview of the UCL group stage from this year, and those interested in the UCL can use it as a reference point to remember relevant information about this stage of the competition.
